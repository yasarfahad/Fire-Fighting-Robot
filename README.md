# Fire-Fighting-Robot
# Fire fighting is an important job but it is very dangerous occupation. Due to that, Robots are designed to extinguish fire, before it rages out of control. It could be used to work with fire fighters to reduce the risk of injury to victims. We present the Fire Fighting Robot that purposely to simulate the real-world operation of an robot to rescue victims and stop fires. The robot development is consisting of three elements which is the hardware, electronic, and programming. The robot consist of  DC motor, Arduino uno , motor shield, Bluetooth module, servo motor, water supply tank ,heat insulating material and it uses camera to identify survivor and help them by dousing fire near them . user interface app is developed to control the robot
